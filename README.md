# PUSH_SWAP (note: 125/125)
The second rank project of 42 school, this project aims to learn to code the sorting algorithms and find one to use for this project.

In order to chose one best method to realise this project, before coding our project it should be better to know some **top sorting algorithms** firstly , how to **creat and implement** them in C, and **why we chose**.

## Sorting Alogrithms
notion: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorting_algorithm
There are so many methods of sorting alorithms existing now. They are mainly classifyed by:
- Computational complexity in terms of the size of the list (n).
- Memory usage
- Recursion
- Stability
- General method: insertion, exchange, selection, merging, etc.
### -Quick sort/Tri rapide
Princinple: Divide and conquer

### Merge sort
wiki: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_sort#Variants
### Bubble sort
### Heap  sort
### Selection sort
### Insertion sort
### Bucket Sort program
### Radix Sort program

## Algorithme I use for this project
quick sort and insertion sort

## How to use
- make 
- make bonus
